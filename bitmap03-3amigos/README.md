## lab 04 Bitmap Transform

# Description
For this assignment we built a Bitmap entry point called index.js, a transformer called bitmap.js and tests called bitmap-test.js. The index  will read a Bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on the bitmap and then write it out to a new file.

# The project has three transforms:
  * Invert the colors
  * Grayscale the colors
  * (red|green|blue)scale the colors, we chose blue.
